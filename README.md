# UX

## 4 Example User Personas

1. __Tom Lynch__ is a __sole trader__. He runs a tiny, stylish hipster coffee shop in Kinsale, Co. Cork. He is fairly tech-savvy and enjoys managing his social media accounts, but does not have the inclination or the time to develop his own website. A friend made one for him using a template site, but he doesn't feel like it reflects the quality of his business. He wants to hire a professional developer to better align his online presence with his offline business. He has a budget of â‚¬2,500 for this purpose.

2. __Annalise Maior__ is the __marketing manager__ of the national branch of a global real estate company. She is tasked with increasing the company's social media presence in Ireland, as several Irish companies have a much stronger following. Her budget for this goal is flexible but she expects a tangible, measurable improvement in their social media KPIs, specifically she wants to outdo the national businesses in terms of engagement and follows.

3. __Rosemary Geoghan__ is the __CEO__ of a mid-sized plumbing company based in Dublin. The business already has a strong industry reputation and its primary clients are large construction firms. Rosemary wants a client portal added to the business's existing website so that detailed and customized project information can be viewed easily by clients.

4. __David Murphy__ is a makeup artist based in Kildare. He is expanding his business and has launched a product line of branded makeup brushes. He wants to delegate out both his social media management and his content creation, so that he can focus on strategy and his day-to-day business.
