# UX

## User Personas - Four Examples

1. __Tom Lynch__ is a __sole trader__. He runs a tiny, stylish hipster coffee shop in Kinsale, Co. Cork. He is fairly tech-savvy and enjoys managing his social media accounts, but does not have the inclination or the time to develop his own website. A friend made one for him using a template site, but he doesn't feel like it reflects the quality of his business. He wants to hire a professional developer to better align his online presence with his offline business. He has a budget of â‚¬2,500 for this purpose.

2. __Annalise Maior__ is the __marketing manager__ of the national branch of a global real estate company. She is tasked with increasing the company's social media presence in Ireland, as several Irish companies have a much stronger following. Her budget for this goal is flexible but she expects a tangible, measurable improvement in their social media KPIs, specifically she wants to outdo the national businesses in terms of engagement and follows.

3. __Rosemary Geoghan__ is the __CEO__ of a mid-sized plumbing company based in Dublin. The business already has a strong industry reputation and its primary clients are large construction firms. Rosemary wants a client portal added to the business's existing website so that detailed and customized project information can be viewed easily by clients.

4. __David Murphy__ is a makeup artist based in Kildare. He is expanding his business and has launched a product line of branded makeup brushes. He wants to delegate both his social media management and his content creation, so that he can focus on strategy and his day-to-day business.

# Strategy

## Project Goals
To create a web application that successfully showcases Lionize's services and offers clients access to a B2B order and payment portal, that both enhances their user experience *and* increases Lionize's customer loyalty and trust.

## Target Users
As outlined above Lionize's target market are businesses in need of digital marketing services. SMEs, sole traders and larget corporations all fall under this umbrella.

## Research
The user registration / dashboard formula for web applications has been around a good while now. It is a tried and tested structure for client communication and engagement.

To research the best design and structural mechanisms to use for this project, I visited a number of Saas and online store websites to see how they present their information and how they structure their payment portals.

## Value to the User
All classes of users benefit from a versatile online ordering and payment system. It streamlines the design process for website orders and it cuts out needless administration for orders that are recurring, such as social media management. 

The informational aspects of the website deliver value insofar as they communicate information about the services on offer, allowing potential clients to make informed decisions on whether or not they want to work with Lionize. 

The user dashboard access, after registration delivers a more personalized service to clients, but in an efficient digital way in keeping with the fast pace of technological innovation.

# Deployment 

## Application deployment using Heroku

1. I created a new Heroku account, then created a new Heroku application selecting Europe as my region, as below: 

<p align="center">
  <img src="static/images/deployment/heroku-deployment-1.png">
</p>

<br>

2. I provisioned a new Postgres database, as below:

<p align="center">
  <img src="static/images/deployment/heroku-deployment-postgres-db.png">
</p>

3. I installed dj_database_url & psycopg2 to enable the connection between Django and Postgres.

4. Then I ran: ``` pip3 freeze > requirements.txt ```

    <p align="center">
        <img src="static/images/deployment/deployment-psyco-djdb.png">
    </p>

5. I imported dj_database_url into my project's settings.py file and then added the POSTGRES database connection as the default database when in production mode alongside the sqlite database, when in development:

<p align="center">
    <img src="static/images/deployment/deployment-db-connection.png">
</p>

6. I created a superuser using ```python3 manage.py createsuperuser```

7. Then I installed gunicorn.

8. I created a Procfile with the following code ```web: gunicorn lionize.wsgi:application``` to tell Heroku to create a web dyno to run gunicorn and serve the application.

9. I temporarily disabled COLLECTSTATIC in the Heroku CLI

<p align="center">
    <img src="static/images/deployment/disable-collectstatic.png">
</p>

10. I added the application's Heroku hostname to ALLOWED_HOSTS in settings.py:

<p align="center">
    <img src="static/images/deployment/deployment-allowed-hosts.png">
</p>


11. I added a SECRET_KEY config variable in Heroku. 

12. I initialized an heroku git remote as below:

<p align="center">
    <img src="static/images/deployment/deploy-heroku-remote.png">
</p>

13. I pushed to Heroku master to deploy using ```git push heroku master```

14. I set up automatic deployments in Heroku by connecting to the Lionize github repo as below:

<p align="center">
    <img src="static/images/deployment/github-heroku-deploy-1.png">
</p>

15. I then enabled automatic deploys by selecting the master branch and clicking the button as below:

<p align="center">
    <img src="static/images/deployment/enable-auto-deploys.png">
</p>

## Setting up AWS S3 

1. I set up an AWS account. 

2. In the AWS Management Console I searched for S3

3. In the S3 Management Console I clicked on "Create bucket" to create a new bucket. I named the bucket lionize-ms4 and selected Europe as my region. I also allowed public access, as below:

<p align="center">
    <img src="static/images/deployment/s3-setup-aws.png">
</p>

4. Once the new bucket was created, I navigated to the properties tab of the bucket and scrolled down to "Static website hosting", clicked "Edit", and then I selected "Enable" under the "Static website hosting" option. I entered index.html & error.html as default values, as below:

<p align="center">
    <img src="static/images/deployment/s3-static-website-hosting1.png">
</p>

<p align="center">
    <img src="static/images/deployment/s3-static-website-hosting2.png">
</p>

5. On the bucket's permissions tab, I added a CORS configuration, as below:

<p align="center">
    <img src="static/images/deployment/s3-cors.png">
</p>

6. On the bucket's policy tab, I clicked on "policy generator" and created a new policy which I added to my bucket.

7. After saving the bucket policy, I scrolled to the "Access control list (ACL)" tab and I checked the list objects box under the "Everyone (public access)" header.

## Setting up AWS Identity and Access Management Configuration

1. In the IAM dashboard I navigated to the "User Groups" tab and created a new group. 

2. Under the policies tab, I clicked on the JSON tab and then "Import managed policy"

<p align="center">
    <img src="static/images/deployment/iam-import-managed-policy.png">
</p>

3. I selected the S3FullAccess policy and clicked import.

<p align="center">
    <img src="static/images/deployment/s3-full-access-policy.png">
</p>

4. I edited the imported JSON code to allow full access to the lionize bucket and its' associated files, using the lionize bucket's arn.

5. I gave the policy a name and description and then created the policy:

<p align="center">
    <img src="static/images/deployment/s3-policy-created.png">
</p>

6. I went back to the "User groups" tab and clicked on the "manage-lionize" group. Then I went to the "permissions" tab and clicked the dropdown menu "Add permission" and then "Attach Policies", I checked the policy just created and then clicked to "Add permissions".

<p align="center">
    <img src="static/images/deployment/iam-policy-attached.png">
</p>


7. I created a user to add to the group with programmatic access.

<p align="center">
    <img src="static/images/deployment/iam-new-user.png">
</p>

8. I downloaded the CSV file containing the new user's access key and secret access key in order to add them to Django to authenticate this user.

9. I then installed boto3 & django-storages, freezing them into requirements.txt and then adding 'storages' to the installed apps list in settings.py

10. I also added the following AWS config variables to my settings.py file for use *only* if the USE_AWS var is found in os.environ:

        AWS_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME = 'lionize-ms4'
        AWS_S3_REGION_NAME = 'eu-west-1'
        AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID = os.environ.get('AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID')
        AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY = os.environ.get('AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY')
        AWS_S3_CUSTOM_DOMAIN = f'{AWS_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME}.s3.amazonaws.com'

        STATICFILES_STORAGE = 'custom_storages.StaticStorage'
        STATICFILES_LOCATION = 'static'
        DEFAULT_FILE_STORAGE = 'custom_storages.MediaStorage'
        MEDIAFILES_LOCATION = 'media'

        STATIC_URL = f'https://{AWS_S3_CUSTOM_DOMAIN}/{STATICFILES_LOCATION}/'
        MEDIA_URL = f'https://{AWS_S3_CUSTOM_DOMAIN}/{MEDIAFILES_LOCATION}/'

11. I then added the Access Keys as well as the USE_AWS=TRue to the Heroku config vars.

12. I committed these changes and pushed to github & thus Heroku (because of automatic deployments) and the build collected all the Static files and placed them in the S3 bucket and Heroku served them successfully. 

13. I then created a new folder in my S3 bucket called Media and set permissions to grant publin-read access as below:

<p align="center">
    <img src="static/images/deployment/s3-media-files-permissions.png">
</p>

14. I then uploaded all my in-app images into that folder.

## Setting up Stripe for Deployment

1. I added the STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY & the STRIPE_SECRET_KEY as config variables in Heroku. 

2. I created a new Production Webhook Endpoint in my Stripe Dashboard by clicking on the "Developers" tab and then "Webhooks" and then "Add endpoint". I then added my application's heroku url + checkout/wh/ to "receive all events", as below:

<p align="center">
    <img src="static/images/deployment/stripe-webhook.png">
</p>

3. I then added the webhook's signing secret to my Heroku config variables.

##Â Setting up Django Emails for Deployment

1. In the application's associated Gmail account I set up 2-step verification. 

2. Then I generated a new app password and added it to my application's config variables in Heroku alongside a EMAIL_HOST_USER variable that stored the associated email. 

3. Then in settings.py I
