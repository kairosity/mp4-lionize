# UX

## User Personas - Four Examples

1. __Tom Lynch__ is a __sole trader__. He runs a tiny, stylish hipster coffee shop in Kinsale, Co. Cork. He is fairly tech-savvy and enjoys managing his social media accounts, but does not have the inclination or the time to develop his own website. A friend made one for him using a template site, but he doesn't feel like it reflects the quality of his business. He wants to hire a professional developer to better align his online presence with his offline business. He has a budget of â‚¬2,500 for this purpose.

2. __Annalise Maior__ is the __marketing manager__ of the national branch of a global real estate company. She is tasked with increasing the company's social media presence in Ireland, as several Irish companies have a much stronger following. Her budget for this goal is flexible but she expects a tangible, measurable improvement in their social media KPIs, specifically she wants to outdo the national businesses in terms of engagement and follows.

3. __Rosemary Geoghan__ is the __CEO__ of a mid-sized plumbing company based in Dublin. The business already has a strong industry reputation and its primary clients are large construction firms. Rosemary wants a client portal added to the business's existing website so that detailed and customized project information can be viewed easily by clients.

4. __David Murphy__ is a makeup artist based in Kildare. He is expanding his business and has launched a product line of branded makeup brushes. He wants to delegate both his social media management and his content creation, so that he can focus on strategy and his day-to-day business.

# Strategy

## Project Goals
To create a web application that successfully showcases Lionize's services and offers clients access to a B2B order and payment portal, that both enhances their user experience *and* increases Lionize's customer loyalty and trust.

## Target Users
As outlined above Lionize's target market are businesses in need of digital marketing services. SMEs, sole traders and larget corporations all fall under this umbrella. 

## Research
The user registration / dashboard formula for web applications has been around a good while now. It is a tried and tested structure for client communication and engagement. 

To research the best design and structural mechanisms to use for this project, I visited a number of Saas and online store websites to see how they present their information and how they structure their payment portals.

## Value to the User
All classes of users benefit from a versatile online ordering and payment system. It streamlines the design process for website orders and it cuts out needless administration for orders that are recurring such as social media management. 

The informational aspects of the website deliver value insofar as they communication information about the services on offer, allowing potential clients to make informed decisions on whether or not they want to work with Lionize. 

The user dashboard access, after registration delivers a more personalized service to clients, but in an efficient digital way in keeping with the fast pace of technological innovation.
